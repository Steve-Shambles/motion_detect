# motion_detect
Webcam motion detect and save

I originally wrote this back in December 2019, I took some years off from Python, now it no longer works in 2023 as opencv had made changes to the module. That must have broken most of the old cv2 code out there, wow, I hope they had a really good reason to do that?

Anyway, after a full day of reading nonsensical docs I turned to chatGtp 3.5 and then V4 and they just led me down a rabbit hole of more nonsense. Eventually I found one fix on Stack Overflow, gawd bless em guv, but much to my surprise it was then Claude+ A.I that gave me all the fixes I needed straight away with no mucking about. I am so impressed with Claude+ maybe it is now the my first port of call for debugging\problem solving.

I have remarked on the fixed lines in the code.
